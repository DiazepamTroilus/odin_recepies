    <p>

    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1.5 pounds (700g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into
        bite-sized
      </li>
      <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ghee or unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup tomato puree</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Marinate the Chicken:</b> In a bowl, combine the yogurt,
        ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala,
        and salt. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are
        well-coated. Cover the bowl and let it marinate for at least 1-2 hours,
        or overnight in the refrigerator for best results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cook the Chicken:</b> Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Thread the
        marinated chicken pieces onto skewers and place them on a baking sheet.
        Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. You can
        also grill the chicken for a smoky flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Prepare the Sauce:</b> In a large pan, heat ghee or butter over
        medium heat. Add chopped onions and sauté until they become golden
        brown. Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for 1-2 minutes until the raw
        smell disappears. Add ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder,
        and red chili powder. Cook for another 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Simmer the Sauce:</b> Add tomato puree and cook until the mixture
        thickens and the oil starts to separate from the spices. Reduce the heat
        to low and stir in the heavy cream. Simmer for 5-7 minutes, allowing the
        flavors to meld.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Combine Chicken and Sauce:</b> Add the baked or grilled chicken
        pieces to the sauce, stirring to coat them evenly. Stir in garam masala
        and kasuri methi (if using). Adjust salt and spice levels according to
        your taste.
      </li>
    </ol>
